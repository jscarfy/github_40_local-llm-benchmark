\begin{frame}{AdS/CFT and quantum entropy flow}
The AdS/CFT correspondence relates quantum gravity in an AdS space to a CFT on the boundary. Quantum entropy flows are influenced by the duality between the bulk and boundary theories, affecting entropy evolution.

\begin{frame}{Modular system transformations in AdS/CFT}
Modular transformations in AdS/CFT are governed by quantum corrections:
\[
[\zeta^{[k]}, \zeta^{[\ell]}] = \mathsf{Q}^{k,\ell}
\]
where $\mathsf{Q}^{k,\ell}$ represents the quantum correction term arising from the bulk-boundary interaction.
