\begin{frame}{Symmetry breaking in quantum entropy flow systems}
Symmetry breaking occurs when an initially symmetric system loses its symmetry, affecting the flow dynamics and modular transformations.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Modular system transformations under symmetry breaking}
Symmetry breaking modifies modular transformations by introducing quantum corrections:
\[
[\zeta^{[k]}, \zeta^{[\ell]}] = \mathsf{Q}^{k,\ell}
\]
where $\mathsf{Q}^{k,\ell}$ represents the quantum correction term caused by the symmetry breaking.
