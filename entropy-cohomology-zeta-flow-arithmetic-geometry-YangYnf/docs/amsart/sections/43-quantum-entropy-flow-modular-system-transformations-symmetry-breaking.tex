% ============================================================

\begin{remark}
This chapter examines the effects of symmetry breaking in quantum entropy flow systems and their impact on modular transformations. It explores how symmetry breaking influences the evolution of quantum systems and the behavior of entropy flow in modular system dynamics.

\subsection{Symmetry breaking in quantum entropy flow systems}

\begin{definition}[Symmetry breaking in quantum entropy flow systems]
Symmetry breaking in quantum entropy flow systems occurs when an initially symmetric system undergoes a transformation that causes a loss of symmetry, leading to modifications in the flow dynamics and modular system behavior.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Modular system transformations under symmetry breaking}

\begin{definition}[Modular system transformations under symmetry breaking]
When symmetry is broken in quantum systems, modular transformations are modified by additional correction terms that reflect the loss of symmetry. These terms are represented by quantum corrections in the commutation relations:
\[
[\zeta^{[k]}, \zeta^{[\ell]}] = \mathsf{Q}^{k,\ell}
\]
where $\mathsf{Q}^{k,\ell}$ is influenced by the symmetry-breaking process.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
The exploration of symmetry breaking provides key insights into how quantum entropy flow systems evolve when symmetries are lost, revealing how the system's behavior changes and the nature of modular transformations in non-symmetric spaces.
