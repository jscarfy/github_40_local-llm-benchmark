\subsection{High-Dimensional Entropy Analysis}
This section explores the analytical methods used to assess entropy in systems with high-dimensional state spaces, including new approaches to system stability.

\begin{definition}[High-dimensional entropy analysis]
High-dimensional entropy analysis involves applying entropy measures to systems that require more than three dimensions for accurate description, focusing on the interplay of multiple interacting variables.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[High-dimensional Stability]
The stability of high-dimensional systems is guaranteed when the following inequality holds:
\[
\| \mathcal{H}_d(T') - \mathcal{H}_d(T) \| \le \delta_d.
\]
\end{theorem}
