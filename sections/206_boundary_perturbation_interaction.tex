\subsection{Boundary Perturbation Interaction}
This section defines the interaction between boundary perturbations and entropy-driven bifurcations.

\begin{definition}[Boundary Perturbation Interaction]
The interaction between boundary perturbations and entropy bifurcations results in shifts of system states, especially when the perturbation crosses the system’s boundary condition.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Boundary Shift Under Perturbation]
When a boundary perturbation exceeds the threshold \( \delta_b \), the system shifts to a new configuration:
\[
\| \mathcal{H}_b(T') - \mathcal{H}_b(T) \| > \delta_b.
\]
\end{theorem}
