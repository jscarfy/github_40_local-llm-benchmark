\subsection{Entropy Dynamic Solutions}
This section addresses the mathematical solutions to entropy dynamics in systems that experience multi-dimensional changes.

\begin{definition}[Entropy dynamic solution]
Entropy dynamic solutions are mathematical expressions that describe the evolution of entropy across a multi-dimensional system.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Stabilizing Solutions]
For entropy dynamics to stabilize in a system, the entropy measures must satisfy:
\[
\| \mathcal{H}_e(T') - \mathcal{H}_e(T) \| \to 0 \quad \text{as} \quad t \to \infty.
\]
\end{theorem}
