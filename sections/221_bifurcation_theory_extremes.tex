\subsection{Bifurcation Theory and Extremes}
This section discusses extreme cases of bifurcation theory, where system behavior approaches critical thresholds.

\begin{definition}[Bifurcation extremes]
Bifurcation extremes occur when a system reaches a critical point, causing a sudden transition to a new state.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Bifurcation Threshold]
When a system approaches a bifurcation extreme, the following condition holds:
\[
\| \mathcal{H}_b(T') - \mathcal{H}_b(T) \| \ge \delta_e.
\]
\end{theorem}
