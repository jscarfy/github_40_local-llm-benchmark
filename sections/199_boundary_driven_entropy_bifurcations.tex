\subsection{Boundary-Driven Entropy Bifurcations}
This section describes boundary-driven bifurcations where perturbations at specific thresholds cause systems to transition into novel stable regions.

\begin{definition}[Boundary-driven entropy bifurcation]
A boundary-driven bifurcation occurs when entropy-driven perturbations exceed a boundary threshold, leading to bifurcations in system behavior:
\[
\| \mathcal{H}_b(T') - \mathcal{H}_b(T) \| > \delta_b.
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Boundary transition under entropy perturbation]
When the perturbation exceeds the boundary \( \delta_b \), the system undergoes a bifurcation and transitions into a new state:
\[
\| \mathcal{H}_b(T') - \mathcal{H}_b(T) \| > \delta_b.
\]
\end{theorem}
