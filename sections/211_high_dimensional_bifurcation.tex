\subsection{High-Dimensional Bifurcation}
This section delves into bifurcation theory in systems where multiple dimensions interact to produce complex behaviors.

\begin{definition}[High-dimensional bifurcation]
High-dimensional bifurcation occurs when the interaction of multiple dimensions of a system leads to a change in the stability of the system.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Dimensional Stability Condition]
For a high-dimensional bifurcation system to remain stable, the following must hold:
\[
\| \mathcal{H}_d(T') - \mathcal{H}_d(T) \| \le \delta_d.
\]
\end{theorem}
