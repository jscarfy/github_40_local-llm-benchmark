\subsection{Perturbation Theory in Bifurcations}
This section delves into perturbation theory and its application to systems undergoing bifurcations due to entropy-driven forces.

\begin{definition}[Perturbation theory in bifurcations]
Perturbation theory in bifurcations studies how small perturbations in system parameters lead to significant changes in system behavior, particularly during bifurcations.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Bifurcation under Perturbation]
When a system undergoes a bifurcation due to perturbation, the system's entropy changes as follows:
\[
\| \mathcal{H}_p(T') - \mathcal{H}_p(T) \| > \delta_p.
\]
\end{theorem}
