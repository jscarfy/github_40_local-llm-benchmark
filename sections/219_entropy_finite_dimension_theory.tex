\subsection{Entropy Finite Dimension Theory}
This section explores the behavior of entropy in systems with finite-dimensional state spaces, focusing on new entropy concepts in finite dimensions.

\begin{definition}[Entropy in Finite Dimensions]
Entropy in finite dimensions refers to the measure of disorder or randomness in a system with a finite number of degrees of freedom.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Finite Dimension Entropy Stability]
For a finite-dimensional system, entropy stability is achieved when the following condition holds:
\[
\| \mathcal{H}_f(T') - \mathcal{H}_f(T) \| \le \delta_f.
\]
\end{theorem}
