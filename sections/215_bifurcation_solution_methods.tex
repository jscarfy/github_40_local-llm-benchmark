\subsection{Bifurcation Solution Methods}
This section explores various solution methods for systems undergoing bifurcations due to entropy-driven dynamics.

\begin{definition}[Bifurcation solution method]
Bifurcation solution methods are mathematical techniques used to solve for system states when a bifurcation occurs.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Bifurcation Stability Solutions]
The stability solutions to bifurcations can be defined by solving the following system of equations:
\[
\| \mathcal{H}_b(T') - \mathcal{H}_b(T) \| \le \delta_b.
\]
\end{theorem}
