\subsection{Entropy Stability Theory}
This section discusses the theory of entropy stability in multi-dimensional systems, focusing on systems subject to perturbations.

\begin{definition}[Entropy stability]
Entropy stability is defined as the ability of a system to maintain a stable entropy measure despite external perturbations.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Entropy Stability Under Perturbation]
For a system to maintain entropy stability, the change in entropy must satisfy the inequality:
\[
\| \mathcal{H}_s(T') - \mathcal{H}_s(T) \| \le \delta_s.
\]
\end{theorem}
