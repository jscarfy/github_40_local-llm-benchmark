\subsection{Entropy Perturbation Theory}
This section examines the perturbation effects on entropy-driven systems, particularly how small changes in system parameters lead to significant behavior shifts.

\begin{definition}[Entropy perturbation theory]
Entropy perturbation theory deals with the study of how perturbations in a system's state variables impact the overall entropy of the system.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Stability under Entropy Perturbation]
For a system to remain stable under entropy perturbation, the change in entropy must satisfy:
\[
\| \mathcal{H}_p(T') - \mathcal{H}_p(T) \| \le \delta_p.
\]
\end{theorem}
