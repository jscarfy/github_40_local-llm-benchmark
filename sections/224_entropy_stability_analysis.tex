\subsection{Entropy Stability Analysis}
This section investigates the analytical methods used to assess the stability of entropy in complex dynamical systems, focusing on the conditions that allow systems to maintain entropy stability.

\begin{definition}[Entropy stability]
Entropy stability refers to the ability of a system to preserve a stable entropy measure under various perturbations or external forces.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Entropy Stability Condition]
A system maintains entropy stability when:
\[
\| \mathcal{H}_s(T') - \mathcal{H}_s(T) \| \le \delta_s.
\]
\end{theorem}
