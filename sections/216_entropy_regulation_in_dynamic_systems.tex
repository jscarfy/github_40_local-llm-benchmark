\subsection{Entropy Regulation in Dynamic Systems}
This section discusses how entropy regulation mechanisms operate in dynamic systems, influencing their long-term behavior.

\begin{definition}[Entropy regulation]
Entropy regulation refers to the process by which a system controls its entropy flow to maintain stability and prevent chaotic transitions.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Entropy Regulation for Stability]
For a system to maintain stability, the entropy regulation must meet the following condition:
\[
\| \mathcal{H}_r(T') - \mathcal{H}_r(T) \| \le \delta_r.
\]
\end{theorem}
