\subsection{Bifurcation Impact Theory}
This section investigates the impact of bifurcations on entropy-driven systems, focusing on how bifurcations lead to new system behaviors.

\begin{definition}[Bifurcation impact theory]
Bifurcation impact theory studies how changes in system parameters cause bifurcations, resulting in significant shifts in entropy-driven behaviors.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Bifurcation-Induced Entropy Shifts]
When a bifurcation occurs, the entropy of the system changes as follows:
\[
\| \mathcal{H}_b(T') - \mathcal{H}_b(T) \| > \delta_b.
\]
\end{theorem}
