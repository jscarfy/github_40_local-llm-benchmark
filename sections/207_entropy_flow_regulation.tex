\subsection{Entropy Flow Regulation}
This section explores the regulation of entropy flow in complex systems, including the constraints that govern the distribution of entropy.

\begin{definition}[Entropy flow regulation]
Entropy flow regulation is the process by which a system maintains a controlled distribution of entropy, ensuring stability even under perturbations.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Entropy Flux Conservation]
In systems with regulated entropy flow, the total entropy flux remains constant across all subsystems:
\[
\int_{D} \mathcal{H}_f(T') \, dV = \int_{D} \mathcal{H}_f(T) \, dV.
\]
\end{theorem}
