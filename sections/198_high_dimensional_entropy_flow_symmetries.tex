\subsection{High-Dimensional Entropy-Flow Symmetries}
High-dimensional entropy-flow symmetries explore transformations that preserve entropy measures across multi-layered strata in bifurcation systems.

\begin{definition}[High-dimensional entropy-flow symmetry]
A high-dimensional entropy-flow symmetry, denoted by \( \mathcal{S}_k \), connects multiple strata of bifurcation systems by preserving their entropy structures:
\[
\mathcal{S}_k(T) \cong \mathcal{S}_k(T').
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Symmetry preservation under high-dimensional flow]
High-dimensional entropy-flow symmetries preserve entropy gradients across multiple strata, satisfying:
\[
\mathcal{S}_k(T) = \mathcal{S}_k(T').
\]
\end{theorem}
