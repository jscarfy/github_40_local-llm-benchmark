\subsection{Perturbation-Induced Stability}
This section focuses on the effects of perturbations on the stability of entropy-driven bifurcations.

\begin{definition}[Perturbation-Induced Stability]
A system is considered stable under perturbation if, after a small change in the initial conditions, the system's final state remains within an acceptable threshold of stability.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Threshold Stability]
When a perturbation exceeds the stability threshold \( \delta \), the system undergoes a bifurcation that results in a new stable configuration:
\[
\| \mathcal{H}(T') - \mathcal{H}(T) \| > \delta.
\]
\end{theorem}
