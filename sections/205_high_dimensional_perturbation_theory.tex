\subsection{High-Dimensional Perturbation Theory}
This section discusses the theory of perturbations in high-dimensional systems and their effect on entropy-driven bifurcations.

\begin{definition}[High-dimensional perturbation]
A high-dimensional perturbation refers to changes in the state variables of a system that affect multiple dimensions simultaneously, leading to complex entropy changes.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Perturbation-Induced Bifurcation]
When a high-dimensional perturbation exceeds a critical value, the system bifurcates into a new stable state:
\[
\| \mathcal{H}_p(T') - \mathcal{H}_p(T) \| > \delta_p.
\]
\end{theorem}
