\subsection{Entropy Theory Integration}
This section explores the integration of entropy theory into complex dynamical systems, including multi-layered approaches.

\begin{definition}[Entropy theory integration]
Entropy theory integration refers to the combination of multiple entropy sources in systems that interact at multiple levels, requiring complex models to explain system behavior.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Integrated Entropy Stability]
When entropy sources interact at multiple layers, the overall system reaches a stable equilibrium represented by:
\[
\| \mathcal{H}_i(T') - \mathcal{H}_i(T) \| \le \delta_i.
\]
\end{theorem}
