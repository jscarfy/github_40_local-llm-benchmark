\subsection{Entropy Dynamics Theory}
This section introduces a theory for entropy-driven dynamics, focusing on how entropy gradients influence system behavior across multi-dimensional spaces.

\begin{definition}[Entropy dynamics theory]
Entropy dynamics theory is the study of how entropy measures govern the transitions between different states in a multi-dimensional system.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Entropy Gradient-Induced Transition]
When the entropy gradient surpasses a critical threshold, the system undergoes a state transition:
\[
\| \mathcal{H}_d(T') - \mathcal{H}_d(T) \| \ge \delta_d.
\]
\end{theorem}
