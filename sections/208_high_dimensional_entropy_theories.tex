\subsection{High-Dimensional Entropy Theories}
This section investigates new entropy theories in systems with high-dimensional state spaces.

\begin{definition}[High-dimensional entropy]
High-dimensional entropy refers to entropy measures applied to systems where the state variables extend beyond three dimensions, often requiring specialized methods of analysis.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[High-dimensional Entropy Stability]
In high-dimensional systems, entropy remains stable when the following condition holds:
\[
\| \mathcal{H}_d(T') - \mathcal{H}_d(T) \| \le \delta_d.
\]
\end{theorem}
