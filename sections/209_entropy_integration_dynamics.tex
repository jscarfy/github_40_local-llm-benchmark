\subsection{Entropy Integration Dynamics}
This section covers the integration of entropy across complex systems and its impact on overall stability and dynamics.

\begin{definition}[Entropy integration]
Entropy integration involves calculating the total entropy across a system by integrating over its entire state space.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Entropy Dynamics Integration]
When integrated over a system's full state, entropy stabilizes and leads to predictable system behavior:
\[
\int_{D} \mathcal{H}_i(T') \, dV = \int_{D} \mathcal{H}_i(T) \, dV.
\]
\end{theorem}
