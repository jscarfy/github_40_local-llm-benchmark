\subsection{High-Dimensional Entropic Interactions}
This section covers how interactions between high-dimensional systems affect the flow of entropy and the system's stability.

\begin{definition}[High-dimensional entropic interaction]
High-dimensional entropic interaction refers to the relationship between entropy measures across systems with more than three dimensions, where the interaction leads to complex entropy flows.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Entropy Interaction Stability]
When the entropy interactions across dimensions are stabilized, the system reaches a predictable equilibrium:
\[
\| \mathcal{H}_i(T') - \mathcal{H}_i(T) \| \le \delta_i.
\]
\end{theorem}
