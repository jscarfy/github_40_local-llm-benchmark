\subsection{High-Dimensional Entropy Mapping}
This section examines how entropy mapping works in high-dimensional systems, where the interaction of numerous variables defines the system's dynamics.

\begin{definition}[High-dimensional entropy mapping]
High-dimensional entropy mapping involves representing the entropy of a system that exists in more than three dimensions, with complex interdependencies between the dimensions.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Stability of High-Dimensional Entropy]
High-dimensional systems remain stable when their entropy mapping satisfies:
\[
\| \mathcal{H}_m(T') - \mathcal{H}_m(T) \| \le \delta_m.
\]
\end{theorem}
