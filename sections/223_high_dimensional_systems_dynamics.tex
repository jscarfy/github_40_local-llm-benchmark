\subsection{High-Dimensional Systems Dynamics}
This section focuses on the dynamics of high-dimensional systems, where the complexity of interactions between variables leads to unpredictable and chaotic behaviThis section focuses on the dynamics of high-dmsThHigh-dimensional systems are those that require more than three dimensions to fully describe the system's state, often involving nonlinear interactions.

\begin{theorem}[High-dimensional Stability]
In high-dimensional systems, stability is guaranteed when the following inequality holds:
\[
\| \mathcal{H}_d(T') - \mathcal{H}_d(T) \| \le \delta_d.
\]
\end{theorem}
