\subsection{Advanced Systems in Entropy-Driven Dynamics}
This section explores the impact of higher-dimensional perturbations on entropy-driven dynamics, introducing new classes of bifurcation systems.

\begin{definition}[Entropy-driven dynamics]
Entropy-driven dynamics refer to systems where entropy gradients dictate the system's transition behavior across higher-dimensional strata.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Complex entropy-induced bifurcations]
When entropy gradients exceed a critical threshold, systems undergo a shift in their stability states, leading to complex bifurcations:
\[
\| \mathcal{H}_c(T') - \mathcal{H}_c(T) \| \ge \delta_c.
\]
\end{theorem}
