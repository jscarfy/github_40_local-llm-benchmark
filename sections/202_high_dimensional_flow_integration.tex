\subsection{High-Dimensional Flow Integration}
This section discusses the integration of high-dimensional flow fields and their implications for bifurcation theory.

\begin{definition}[High-Dimensional Flow Integration]
High-dimensional flow integration involves the analysis of entropy flows in systems with more than three interacting dimensions, where each dimension introduces new variables affecting system behavior.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Flow Stabilization]
When integrated over a high-dimensional space, the flow of entropy stabilizes the system, yielding the following relationship:
\[
\int_{D} \mathcal{H}(T') \, dV = \int_{D} \mathcal{H}(T) \, dV.
\]
\end{theorem}
