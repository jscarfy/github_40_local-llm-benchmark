\subsection{New Entropy Theory in Advanced Systems}
This section introduces a new theory of entropy in the context of advanced bifurcation systems, focusing on multi-dimensional entropy flows.

\begin{definition}[New Entropy Theory]
New entropy theory deals with systems that incorporate multiple interacting entropy sources, each contributing to the overall state of the system.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Entropy Flow Stability]
For a system to remain stable, the total entropy flux through the system must satisfy the following inequality:
\[
\| \mathcal{H}(T') - \mathcal{H}(T) \| \le \delta.
\]
\end{theorem}
