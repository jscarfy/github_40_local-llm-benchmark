\subsection{High-Dimensional Entropy Integral}
This section discusses the integration of entropy over high-dimensional systems, including methods for calculating total entropy in systems with many variables.

\begin{definition}[High-Dimensional Entropy Integral]
The high-dimensional entropy integral involves computing the total entropy of a system across all interacting dimensions.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Entropy Integral Stability]
For high-dimensional systems, the entropy integral satisfies the following equation:
\[
\int_{D} \mathcal{H}_i(T') \, dV = \int_{D} \mathcal{H}_i(T) \, dV.
\]
\end{theorem}
