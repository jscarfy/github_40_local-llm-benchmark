\section{Flow Massey Towers and Entropy Obstructions}
\subsection{Entropy Massey towers}
We construct flow Massey towers encoding higher-order interaction between entropy-deformed operators.

\subsection{Obstruction classes}
We define entropy obstruction classes detected by failure of stabilization at higher tower levels.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Obstruction as failure of stabilization]
Higher obstructions appear as entropy-instability in iterated flow compositions.
