\section{Flow Derivatives and Entropy Differential Operators}
\subsection{Flow derivatives}
We introduce flow derivatives as operators encoding the variation of modular data with respect to entropy-driven deformation parameters.

\subsection{Entropy differential operators}
We define entropy differential operators that map modular functions to their entropy-adjusted derivatives.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Differentiation as entropy-modified]
Differentiation is reformulated as entropy-modified, where derivatives are adjusted for flow-based deformations.
