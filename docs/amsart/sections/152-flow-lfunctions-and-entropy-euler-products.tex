\section{Flow $L$-Functions and Entropy Euler Products}
\subsection{Entropy-deformed Euler products}
We model entropy-deformed Euler products by allowing local factors to vary along flow parameters,
keeping a controlled multiplicativity constraint expressed via trace compatibility.

\subsection{Flow analytic continuation heuristics}
We propose a flow-based continuation principle: analytic continuation is replaced by a deformation-stability property
of local factor families and their entropy-regularized global synthesis.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Euler products as flow-systems]
Euler products become \emph{flow-systems of local factors}, and the global $L$-object is characterized by stability
under entropy-compatible deformation.
