\section{Modular Boundaries, Entropy Strata, and Flow Compactifications}
\subsection{Entropy stratification of modular boundaries}
We describe modular boundary components as entropy strata, where flow parameters control degeneration profiles
and arithmetic invariants are tracked by stratified traces.

\subsection{Flow compactification principles}
We propose a compactification principle in which boundary extension is governed by flow-stability rather than by
purely geometric closure, producing a deformation-aware compactified modular object.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Boundary as entropy stratification]
The boundary is recast as an \emph{entropy-stratified interface} whose structure records deformation behavior and
organizes arithmetic data by flow regimes.
