\section{Flow-Modified Modular Functions}
\subsection{Transformation of modular functions under flow symmetries}
We examine the transformation of modular functions under flow symmetries, focusing on the resulting changes in their structure and arithmetic properties.

\subsection{Flow symmetries and the behavior of modular functions}
We investigate how flow symmetries influence the behavior of modular functions, with a particular focus on their implications for arithmetic geometry and modular relations.
