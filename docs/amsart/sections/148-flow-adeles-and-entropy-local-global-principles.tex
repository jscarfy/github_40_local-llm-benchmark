\section{Flow Ad\`eles and Entropy Local--Global Principles}
\subsection{Flow-modified ad\`elic objects}
We define flow-modified ad\`elic objects in which local components carry entropy weights compatible with
modular flows, allowing arithmetic data to evolve under deformation while preserving a controlled product structure.

\subsection{Entropy local--global constraints}
We formulate entropy local--global principles: global compatibility is characterized by a trace-balance identity
across places, stabilized by flow symmetries and expressed via a deformation-invariant pairing.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Local--global as trace-balance]
The local--global principle is re-expressed as a \emph{flow-stable trace equality} across places, replacing
static compatibility conditions by a deformation-invariant constraint.
