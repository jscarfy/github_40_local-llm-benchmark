\section{Modular Flow Transformations and Automorphic Functions}
\subsection{Impact of modular flow transformations on automorphic functions}
We explore the effect of modular flow transformations on automorphic functions, focusing on how flow symmetries modify their structure and arithmetic properties.

\subsection{Flow-induced automorphic transformations in modular systems}
We investigate the flow-induced transformations in automorphic functions, offering new perspectives on the behavior of automorphic functions under modular transformations and flow symmetries.
