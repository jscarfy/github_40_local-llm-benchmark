\section{Flow Modifications of Arithmetic Properties}
\subsection{Transformation of arithmetic properties under modular flow symmetries}
We study the transformation of arithmetic properties under the influence of modular flow symmetries, focusing on the resulting changes in the behavior of arithmetic functions.

\subsection{Flow-induced modifications in arithmetic theory}
We explore how flow symmetries induce new modifications in arithmetic theory, providing fresh perspectives on the relationships between modular theory and arithmetic geometry.
