\section{Modular Symmetries and Arithmetic Operators}
\subsection{Arithmetic operators modified by modular symmetries}
We study how modular symmetries modify arithmetic operators, such as Hecke operators and modular operators, and their role in modular transformations.

\subsection{Impact of modular symmetries on arithmetic operators}
We examine the impact of modular symmetries on arithmetic operators, particularly focusing on their behavior under flow transformations and their interaction with modular functions.
