\section{Flow-Modified Modular Cohomology}
\subsection{Modular cohomology under flow symmetries}
We explore how modular cohomology is modified under flow symmetries, with a focus on the changes in the structure of cohomology classes and their arithmetic interpretations.

\subsection{Flow-induced cohomological transformations in modular systems}
We study the flow-induced transformations in modular cohomology, providing new perspectives on the behavior of cohomology classes under modular symmetries.
