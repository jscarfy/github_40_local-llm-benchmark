\section{Flow Modifications of Modular Form Operators}
\subsection{Modification of Hecke operators under flow symmetries}
We study how Hecke operators are modified under the influence of flow symmetries, exploring the resulting changes in modular forms and arithmetic relations.

\subsection{New modular form operators arising from flow symmetries}
We explore new modular form operators introduced by flow symmetries, offering new methods for analyzing modular forms and their arithmetic properties.
