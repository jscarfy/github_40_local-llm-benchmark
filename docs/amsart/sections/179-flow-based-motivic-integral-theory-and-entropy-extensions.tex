\section{Flow-Based Motivic Integral Theory and Entropy Extensions}
\subsection{Motivic integrals under flow symmetries}
We extend motivic integration theory to include flow symmetries, where integrals are weighted by entropy-induced deformations.

\subsection{Entropy extensions in motivic theory}
We define entropy extensions in motivic theory, introducing flow-invariant objects and integrating across entropy-weighted spaces.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Integrals as entropy-modulated]
Motivic integrals are reinterpreted as entropy-modulated operators, with flow-induced weights.
