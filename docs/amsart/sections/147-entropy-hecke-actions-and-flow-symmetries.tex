\section{Entropy Hecke Actions and Flow Symmetries}
\subsection{Entropy-deformed Hecke operators}
We introduce entropy-deformed Hecke operators as flow-compatible correspondences acting on modular data.
These operators interpolate between classical Hecke actions and flow-perturbed dynamics, encoding arithmetic
information in an entropy-weighted operator calculus.

\subsection{Flow equivariance and arithmetic invariants}
We study equivariance constraints for Hecke actions under flow symmetries and extract the resulting invariant
quantities (entropy-weighted traces, stabilized eigenpackets, and flow-compatible congruence data).

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Entropy-deformed Hecke syntax]
Hecke operators become \emph{flow-covariant} transformations, and arithmetic invariants appear as fixed points of
a deformation rule rather than as static classical objects.
