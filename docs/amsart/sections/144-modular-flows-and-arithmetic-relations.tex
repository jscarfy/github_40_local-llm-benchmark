\section{Modular Flows and Arithmetic Relations}
\subsection{Relation between modular flows and arithmetic functions}
We study the relationship between modular flows and arithmetic functions, focusing on how these flows influence the structural and functional properties of modular systems.

\subsection{Flow-induced changes in arithmetic relations}
We investigate the changes induced by modular flow symmetries in arithmetic relations, providing new perspectives on the interplay between modular systems and their arithmetic geometry.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Flow-modified arithmetic relations]
Modular flows induce new relations in arithmetic functions, providing deeper understanding of the relationships between modular systems and their arithmetic geometry.
