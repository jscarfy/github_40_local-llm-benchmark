\section{Entropy Intertwining Operators and Flow Functorial Lifts}
\subsection{Entropy intertwining operators}
We introduce entropy intertwining operators as deformation-aware transport maps between flow-modified representations
or modular objects, preserving entropy-weighted trace data.

\subsection{Flow functorial lifts}
We define flow functorial lifts as entropy-compatible correspondences transporting spectral packets across contexts,
subject to a deformation-commutativity constraint on traces and local factors.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Lifts as trace-commuting transport]
Functorial lifting is recast as \emph{trace-commuting transport} under deformation, replacing rigid lifts by entropy-stable intertwiners.
