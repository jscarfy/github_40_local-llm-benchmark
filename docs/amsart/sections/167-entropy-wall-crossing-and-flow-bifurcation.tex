\section{Entropy Wall-Crossing and Flow Bifurcation}
\subsection{Entropy walls}
We define entropy walls as critical loci in parameter space where flow-stable invariants undergo qualitative change.

\subsection{Bifurcation phenomena}
We analyze bifurcation of spectral packets and trace data across entropy walls, formulating invariance and jump laws.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Wall-crossing as trace bifurcation]
Wall-crossing is expressed as controlled bifurcation of entropy-stabilized traces rather than discontinuous failure.
