\section{Entropy Modular Correspondences and Flow Functoriality}
\subsection{Entropy modular correspondences}
We define entropy modular correspondences as flow-compatible relations between modular objects that preserve
entropy-weighted trace data and transport arithmetic invariants functorially.

\subsection{Flow functoriality and trace transport}
We formulate flow functoriality: correspondences induce trace-transport maps commuting with deformation,
yielding a syntactic functorial framework for modular arithmetic data.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Functoriality via trace transport]
Functoriality is encoded as \emph{trace transport commuting with deformation}, replacing rigid geometric functors by
a flow-stable correspondence calculus.
