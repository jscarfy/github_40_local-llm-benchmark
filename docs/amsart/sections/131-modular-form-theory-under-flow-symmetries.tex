\section{Modular Form Theory Under Flow Symmetries}
\subsection{Impact of flow symmetries on modular form transformations}
We explore the impact of flow symmetries on modular form transformations, focusing on the resulting structural and arithmetic changes in modular forms.

\subsection{Flow symmetries in the study of modular function properties}
We investigate how flow symmetries influence modular functions, offering fresh perspectives on their properties, transformations, and arithmetic interpretations.
