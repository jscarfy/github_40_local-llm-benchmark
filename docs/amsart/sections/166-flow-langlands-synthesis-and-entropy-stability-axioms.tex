\section{Flow Langlands Synthesis and Entropy Stability Axioms}
\subsection{Synthesis principle}
We propose a synthesis principle: Langlands-type correspondences are reconstructed as compatibility of entropy-stable
spectral packets, trace transfers, and flow-local factor systems.

\subsection{Entropy stability axioms}
We state entropy stability axioms governing deformation invariance of traces, transport maps, and boundary stratifications.
These axioms serve as the syntactic backbone for a flow-based Langlands formalism.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Correspondence as stability of transports]
Correspondence is reformulated as \emph{stability of transport and trace structures under deformation}, replacing rigid matching with entropy-stable compatibility.
