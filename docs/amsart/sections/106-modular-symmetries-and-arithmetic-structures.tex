\section{Modular Symmetries and Arithmetic Structures}
\subsection{Structures of modular systems under flow symmetries}
We explore how modular symmetries generate new structures in modular systems, particularly focusing on the algebraic and geometric consequences of these symmetries.

\subsection{Impact of flow symmetries on modular forms and arithmetic relations}
We study the modifications in modular forms and their arithmetic relationships under the influence of flow symmetries.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Flow-modified modular structures]
Flow symmetries induce new algebraic and geometric structures in modular systems, offering insights into the behavior of modular forms and their arithmetic properties.
