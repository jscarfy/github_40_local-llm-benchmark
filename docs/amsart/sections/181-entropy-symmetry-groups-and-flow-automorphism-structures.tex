\section{Entropy Symmetry Groups and Flow Automorphism Structures}
\subsection{Symmetry groups under flow deformation}
We define symmetry groups under flow deformation, where group elements act as entropy-modulated automorphisms on modular structures.

\subsection{Flow automorphisms}
We introduce flow automorphisms that preserve modular relations while adjusting the structural symmetries under entropy modifications.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Automorphism as entropy-modulation]
Automorphisms are modeled as entropy-modulated actions preserving modular relations.
