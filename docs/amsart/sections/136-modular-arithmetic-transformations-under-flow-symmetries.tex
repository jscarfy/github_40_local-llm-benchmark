\section{Modular Arithmetic Transformations Under Flow Symmetries}
\subsection{Transformation of arithmetic relations under flow symmetries}
We study the transformation of arithmetic relations under the influence of flow symmetries, focusing on their effects on modular systems and their corresponding arithmetic invariants.

\subsection{Flow-induced transformations in modular arithmetic functions}
We examine the transformations induced by flow symmetries in modular arithmetic functions, offering new insights into the relationships between modular systems, arithmetic functions, and modular invariants.
