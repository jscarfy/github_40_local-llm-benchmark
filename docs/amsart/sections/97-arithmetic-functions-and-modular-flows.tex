\section{Arithmetic Functions and Modular Flows}
\subsection{Transformation of arithmetic functions under flow symmetries}
We examine how flow symmetries transform arithmetic functions, such as L-functions and divisor functions, and analyze their behavior under modular flow transformations.

\subsection{Impact of modular flows on the structure of arithmetic functions}
We study how modular flows affect the structure of arithmetic functions, particularly their role in modular systems and their interactions with modular forms.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Flow-modified arithmetic functions]
Flow symmetries lead to new formulations of arithmetic functions, providing insights into their behavior and relationships in modular systems.
