\section{Modular Symmetries and Arithmetic Operators}
\subsection{Modification of Hecke operators under modular symmetries}
We investigate the impact of modular symmetries on Hecke operators, focusing on the resulting transformations in arithmetic structures and their role in modular theory.

\subsection{Flow modifications of arithmetic operators in modular systems}
We study how flow symmetries modify arithmetic operators, particularly the behavior of modular operators under different flow transformations.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Flow-modified Hecke operators]
Flow symmetries induce new transformations in Hecke operators, offering fresh insights into modular systems and arithmetic functions.
