\section{Flow Quantization of Modular Dynamics and Entropy Operators}
\subsection{Quantized modular dynamics}
We propose a flow quantization of modular dynamics by promoting flow evolution rules to operatorial transformations
acting on modular states, with entropy controlling admissible transitions.

\subsection{Entropy operators and commutation constraints}
We define entropy operators governing deformation energy/complexity and impose commutation constraints ensuring
compatibility with modular symmetries, trace stabilization, and spectral packet transport.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Dynamics as operator calculus]
Modular dynamics is expressed as an \emph{operator calculus} with entropy as the controlling observable, replacing static transformation laws by quantized flow evolution.
