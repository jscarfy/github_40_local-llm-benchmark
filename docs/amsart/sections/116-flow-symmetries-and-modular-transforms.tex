\section{Flow Symmetries and Modular Transforms}
\subsection{Transformation of modular systems under flow symmetries}
We study how modular systems transform under the influence of flow symmetries, focusing on the changes in their arithmetic and geometric properties.

\subsection{New modular transformations arising from flow symmetries}
We investigate how flow symmetries give rise to new modular transformations, shedding light on the connections between modular forms, arithmetic geometry, and flow-induced structures.
