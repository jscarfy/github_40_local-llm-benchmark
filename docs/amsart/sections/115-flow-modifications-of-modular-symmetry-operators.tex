\section{Flow Modifications of Modular Symmetry Operators}
\subsection{Symmetry operators in modular systems under flow transformations}
We examine how symmetry operators in modular systems are modified under flow transformations, providing insights into the resulting arithmetic and geometric properties.

\subsection{New modular symmetry operators arising from flow symmetries}
We explore how new modular symmetry operators are introduced by flow symmetries, focusing on their role in modular transformations and arithmetic functions.
