\section{Entropy Fourier Expansions and Flow Cuspidality}
\subsection{Entropy-weighted Fourier expansions}
We define entropy-weighted Fourier expansions in which coefficients carry flow-dependent weights.
This re-encodes growth, decay, and arithmetic oscillation into a single deformation parameter.

\subsection{Flow cuspidality and vanishing criteria}
We propose a flow cuspidality criterion: cusp vanishing is replaced by a flow-vanishing regime characterized by
entropy-weighted decay along modular boundary strata.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Cuspidality as entropy-decay]
Cuspidality becomes a \emph{deformation-decay constraint} rather than an absolute vanishing statement, enabling
continuous interpolation between cusp-like and non-cusp-like regimes.
