\section{Flow Modular Theory and Arithmetic Functions}
\subsection{Interaction between flow modular theory and arithmetic functions}
We examine the interaction between flow modular theory and arithmetic functions, focusing on the resulting structural changes in modular systems and their arithmetic interpretations.

\subsection{Flow-modified modular systems and arithmetic functions}
We explore the changes in modular systems under flow symmetries, offering new insights into the structure and classification of modular functions.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Flow-modified modular systems]
Flow symmetries induce transformations in modular systems, shedding light on the classification and structure of modular functions and their arithmetic properties.
