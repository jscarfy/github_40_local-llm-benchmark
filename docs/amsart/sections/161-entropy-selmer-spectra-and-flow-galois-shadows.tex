\section{Entropy Selmer Spectra and Flow Galois Shadows}
\subsection{Entropy Selmer spectra}
We introduce entropy Selmer spectra as flow-indexed spectral invariants encoding Selmer-like constraints through
entropy-weighted compatibility conditions and stabilized traces.

\subsection{Flow Galois shadows}
We define flow Galois shadows as deformation-aware avatars of Galois-type symmetry data, extracted from entropy Selmer spectra
via a trace-shadow correspondence.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Galois data as spectral shadows]
Galois-type symmetry is recovered as a \emph{spectral shadow} of entropy Selmer constraints, organized by deformation rather than by rigid representation.
