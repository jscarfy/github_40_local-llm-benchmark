\section{Modular Symmetries and Arithmetic Geometries}
\subsection{Geometries induced by modular symmetries}
We explore how modular symmetries induce new geometries in modular systems, particularly focusing on their impact on the underlying arithmetic structures and transformations.

\subsection{Impact of modular symmetries on geometric and arithmetic relations}
We study the role of modular symmetries in shaping the geometric and arithmetic relations in modular systems, offering new interpretations of modular forms and their transformations.
