\section{Entropy Poincar\'e Series and Flow-Generated Modularity}
\subsection{Flow-generated Poincar\'e series}
We define flow-generated Poincar\'e series by inserting entropy weights into orbit sums.
This yields a modularity generator that depends continuously on flow parameters.

\subsection{Entropy convergence windows}
We analyze convergence windows controlled by entropy decay and propose a deformation-theoretic classification
of regimes where flow-generated modular objects are stable, divergent, or renormalizable.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Modularity from entropy-weighted orbit sums]
Modularity is reconstructed from \emph{entropy-weighted orbit synthesis}, making modular forms appear as fixed points
of a flow-dependent generating process.
