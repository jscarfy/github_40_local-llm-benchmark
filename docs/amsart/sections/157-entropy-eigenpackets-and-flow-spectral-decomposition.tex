\section{Entropy Eigenpackets and Flow Spectral Decomposition}
\subsection{Entropy eigenpackets}
We define entropy eigenpackets as flow-stable families of eigen-data obtained from entropy-deformed operators.
They organize spectral information into packets that persist across deformation regimes.

\subsection{Flow spectral decomposition}
We formulate a flow spectral decomposition principle: decomposition is performed in a deformation-aware basis,
where spectral contributions are weighted by entropy measures and traced through stabilized packets.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Spectral data as packet stability]
Spectral structure is recast as \emph{stability of eigenpackets under deformation} rather than as a single rigid decomposition.
