\section{Modular Symmetries and Arithmetic Categories}
\subsection{Categorical interpretations of modular symmetries}
We study the categorical interpretations of modular symmetries, focusing on how these symmetries inform the structure of modular categories and their interactions with arithmetic.

\subsection{Flow modifications of arithmetic categories}
We explore how flow symmetries modify arithmetic categories, providing new methods for classifying modular objects and their relationships to arithmetic geometry.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Flow-modified arithmetic categories]
Flow symmetries induce new categorical structures, offering a deeper understanding of modular categories and their connection to arithmetic geometry.
