\section{Flow Renormalization of Modular Invariants and Entropy Counterterms}
\subsection{Renormalized modular invariants}
We define renormalized modular invariants as flow-stabilized quantities obtained by subtracting entropy-driven
counterterms that remove divergence across deformation regimes.

\subsection{Entropy counterterm calculus}
We introduce an entropy counterterm calculus organizing corrections by boundary strata, spectral growth, and trace anomalies,
yielding a consistent deformation-stable invariant extraction procedure.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Invariants via counterterm subtraction]
Invariants are produced by a \emph{counterterm subtraction syntax} that turns divergent flow data into stable modular quantities.
