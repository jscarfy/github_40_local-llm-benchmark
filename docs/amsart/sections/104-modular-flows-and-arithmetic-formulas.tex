\section{Modular Flows and Arithmetic Formulas}
\subsection{Formulas for modular systems under flow symmetries}
We derive formulas for modular systems under flow symmetries, exploring their impact on modular forms and the structure of arithmetic identities.

\subsection{Impact of flow transformations on modular formulas}
We study how flow transformations modify modular formulas, providing new methods for analyzing modular systems and their connections to arithmetic functions.
