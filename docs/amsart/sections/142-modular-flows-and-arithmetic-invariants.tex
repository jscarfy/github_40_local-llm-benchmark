\section{Modular Flows and Arithmetic Invariants}
\subsection{Impact of modular flows on arithmetic invariants}
We investigate the effects of modular flows on arithmetic invariants, focusing on the transformation of invariants under these flows and their applications in arithmetic geometry.

\subsection{Flow-induced changes in modular invariants}
We explore how flow symmetries induce changes in modular invariants, providing new methods for computing and understanding arithmetic invariants in modular systems.
