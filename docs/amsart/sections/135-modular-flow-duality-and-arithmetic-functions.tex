\section{Modular Flow Duality and Arithmetic Functions}
\subsection{Duality of modular flows and arithmetic structures}
We explore the duality between modular flows and arithmetic functions, analyzing how dual transformations enhance the understanding of modular symmetries and their relationships to arithmetic functions.

\subsection{Impact of modular flow duality on function theory}
We investigate the impact of modular flow duality on the theory of modular functions, offering new perspectives on their structure and transformation properties.
