\section{Entropy Geometry and Flow Modular Extensions}
\subsection{Entropy geometry}
We introduce entropy geometry as a framework for organizing modular structures and invariants under deformation processes.

\subsection{Flow modular extensions}
We define flow modular extensions as generalized modular structures parametrized by entropy.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Geometry as entropy organization]
Geometry becomes the organization of modular structures under entropy flow.
