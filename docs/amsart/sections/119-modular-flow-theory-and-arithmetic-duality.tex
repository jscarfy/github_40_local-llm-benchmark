\section{Modular Flow Theory and Arithmetic Duality}
\subsection{Flow transformations and modular dualities}
We study the interaction between flow symmetries and arithmetic dualities, focusing on how flow transformations lead to new forms of duality in modular systems.

\subsection{Arithmetic duality in modular flow systems}
We investigate how the duality theory in modular systems is enhanced by flow symmetries, with a focus on its implications for arithmetic geometry and modular forms.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Flow-modified arithmetic dualities]
Flow symmetries modify arithmetic duality structures, offering new perspectives on the relationships between modular systems and arithmetic geometry.
