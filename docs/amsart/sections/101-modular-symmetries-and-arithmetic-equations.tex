\section{Modular Symmetries and Arithmetic Equations}
\subsection{Equations induced by modular symmetries}
We explore how modular symmetries lead to the creation of new equations in modular systems, focusing on their role in determining modular forms and arithmetic identities.

\subsection{Flow-induced modifications of modular equations}
We study how flow symmetries modify modular equations, providing new methods for analyzing the behavior of modular systems under various flow transformations.
