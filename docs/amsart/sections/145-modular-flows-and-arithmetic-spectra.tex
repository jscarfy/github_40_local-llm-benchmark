\section{Modular Flows and Arithmetic Spectra}
\subsection{Spectral transformations in modular systems under flow symmetries}
We investigate the spectral transformations in modular systems under the influence of flow symmetries, focusing on how these transformations alter the spectrum of modular systems and their arithmetic interpretations.

\subsection{Flow-induced changes in arithmetic spectra}
We explore the impact of modular flow symmetries on the arithmetic spectra of modular systems, providing new methods for analyzing spectral properties in the context of modular flows.
