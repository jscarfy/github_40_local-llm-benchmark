\section{Modular Symmetries and Arithmetic Duality}
\subsection{Duality structures in modular systems}
We study the duality structures arising in modular systems due to modular symmetries, particularly focusing on their role in arithmetic and geometric dualities.

\subsection{Flow-induced dualities in modular systems}
We explore the impact of flow symmetries on dualities within modular systems, providing new methods for understanding the interplay between arithmetic dualities and modular transformations.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Flow-modified modular dualities]
Flow symmetries induce new duality structures in modular systems, offering insights into the deeper relations between modular forms and arithmetic dualities.
