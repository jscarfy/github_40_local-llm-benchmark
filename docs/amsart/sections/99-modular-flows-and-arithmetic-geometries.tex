\section{Modular Flows and Arithmetic Geometries}
\subsection{Transformation of modular geometries under flow symmetries}
We examine how modular geometries are transformed under flow symmetries, leading to new insights into their geometric structures and their impact on arithmetic identities.

\subsection{Impact of flow-induced transformations on modular geometries}
We study the effect of flow-induced transformations on modular geometries, providing a new perspective on modular forms and their relations with arithmetic functions.
