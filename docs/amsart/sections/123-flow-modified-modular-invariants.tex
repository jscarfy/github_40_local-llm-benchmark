\section{Flow-Modified Modular Invariants}
\subsection{Impact of flow symmetries on modular invariants}
We explore the impact of flow symmetries on modular invariants, focusing on how these symmetries influence the arithmetic and geometric properties of modular spaces.

\subsection{New invariants arising from flow transformations}
We investigate how new modular invariants are introduced by flow symmetries, offering insights into the deeper connections between modular systems and arithmetic geometry.
