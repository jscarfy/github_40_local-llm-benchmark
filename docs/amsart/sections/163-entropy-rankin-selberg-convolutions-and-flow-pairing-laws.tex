\section{Entropy Rankin--Selberg Convolutions and Flow Pairing Laws}
\subsection{Entropy-deformed convolutions}
We define entropy-deformed Rankin--Selberg convolutions by inserting flow weights into the convolution kernel,
producing deformation-aware pairings between modular/automorphic objects.

\subsection{Flow pairing laws}
We formulate flow pairing laws as compatibility identities for entropy-deformed pairings, expressed via trace-regularized
bilinear forms and stabilized spectral measures.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Pairings as flow-regularized kernels]
Classical convolution pairings are recast as \emph{flow-regularized kernels} whose stability under deformation encodes arithmetic compatibility.
