\section{Entropy Harmonic Analysis on Flow Modular Spaces}
\subsection{Entropy-weighted harmonic analysis}
We develop entropy-weighted harmonic analysis on flow modular spaces, where test functions, kernels, and transforms
carry deformation parameters controlling smoothing and spectral concentration.

\subsection{Flow transforms and spectral control}
We define flow transforms (entropy-weighted Fourier/Mellin-like operators) that control spectral localization
and provide a deformation-aware decomposition of modular signals.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Analysis as entropy-controlled localization]
Harmonic analysis becomes \emph{entropy-controlled localization}, turning classical transforms into deformation-aware operators that tune spectral resolution.
