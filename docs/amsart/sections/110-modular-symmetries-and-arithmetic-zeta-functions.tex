\section{Modular Symmetries and Arithmetic Zeta Functions}
\subsection{Zeta functions in modular systems under flow symmetries}
We examine how zeta functions in modular systems are modified by flow symmetries, particularly focusing on their transformation behavior and impact on arithmetic geometry.

\subsection{Impact of flow symmetries on the structure of zeta functions}
We study how flow symmetries affect the structure of zeta functions, providing new perspectives on their role in modular forms and arithmetic functions.
