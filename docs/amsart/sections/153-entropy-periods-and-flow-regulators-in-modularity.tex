\section{Entropy Periods and Flow Regulators in Modularity}
\subsection{Entropy periods}
We define entropy periods as flow-dependent integrals/pairings whose values interpolate between classical periods
and deformation-corrected invariants.

\subsection{Flow regulators}
We introduce flow regulators as entropy-weighted trace functionals controlling the deformation of period data and
its compatibility with modular symmetries.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Periods as deformation-invariants]
Period data becomes a \emph{flow-invariant output} stabilized by entropy regulators rather than a fixed classical integral.
