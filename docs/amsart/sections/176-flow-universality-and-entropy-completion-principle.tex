\section{Flow Universality and the Entropy Completion Principle}
\subsection{Universality}
We propose a universality principle: all arithmetic invariants arise as entropy-stable limits of flow processes.

\subsection{Entropy completion}
We define entropy completion as closure under flow-stable limits.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Mathematics as completed flow]
Arithmetic geometry is recast as the entropy-completion of flow dynamics.
