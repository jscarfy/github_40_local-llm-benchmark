\section{Modular Symmetries and Level Structures}
\subsection{Level structures in modular systems under flow symmetries}
We investigate the interaction between modular symmetries and level structures under flow symmetries, focusing on how these structures transform and their implications for modular forms.

\subsection{Impact of flow symmetries on the modular level structure theory}
We explore the effects of flow symmetries on modular level structures, examining how these symmetries influence the interpretation and classification of modular forms.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Flow-modified level structures]
Flow symmetries modify modular level structures, offering new perspectives on the role of level structure in the theory of modular forms.
