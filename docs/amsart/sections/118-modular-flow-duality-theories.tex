\section{Modular Flow Duality Theories}
\subsection{Duality structures in modular flow systems}
We study the duality structures arising in modular systems due to flow symmetries, particularly focusing on their role in understanding modular relations and arithmetic functions.

\subsection{Flow-induced dualities and their impact on modular transformations}
We explore how flow symmetries introduce new duality structures in modular systems, providing new methods for interpreting modular transformations and their associated arithmetic relations.
