\section{Flow Congruences, Entropy Level Raising, and Stability}
\subsection{Flow congruence relations}
We define flow congruence relations as deformation-compatible congruences between modular/automorphic data,
measured by entropy-weighted discrepancy functions.

\subsection{Entropy level raising}
We propose an entropy level raising mechanism: level transitions are triggered by flow thresholds at which
congruence defects vanish in a stabilized trace sense.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Level raising as threshold stabilization]
Level raising is expressed as a \emph{threshold phenomenon} where entropy-weighted congruence defects stabilize to zero.
