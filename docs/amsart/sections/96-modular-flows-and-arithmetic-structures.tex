\section{Modular Flows and Arithmetic Structures}
\subsection{Structures of modular systems under flow symmetries}
We study the structures of modular systems under flow symmetries, examining how these symmetries induce new algebraic and geometric properties in modular forms and arithmetic relations.

\subsection{Impact of modular flows on algebraic structures}
We analyze how modular flows modify algebraic structures, particularly focusing on the relationships between modular forms, divisor functions, and L-functions under flow transformations.
