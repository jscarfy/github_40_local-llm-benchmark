\section{Flow Trace Formulas and Entropy Spectral Measures}
\subsection{Entropy spectral measures}
We introduce entropy spectral measures attached to modular flows, encoding the distribution of flow-eigenvalues
through trace-regularized moment identities.

\subsection{Flow trace formula schema}
We formulate a flow trace formula schema in which geometric-side contributions are flow-stratified and spectral-side
contributions are entropy-weighted, enabling controlled comparison across deformation regimes.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Trace formula as deformation identity]
The trace formula becomes an \emph{identity of flow-deformed measures}, turning classical geometric/spectral matching
into a stability principle under entropy deformation.
