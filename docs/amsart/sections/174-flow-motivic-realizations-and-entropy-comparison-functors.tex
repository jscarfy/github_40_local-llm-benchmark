\section{Flow Motivic Realizations and Entropy Comparison Functors}
\subsection{Flow motivic realizations}
We construct motivic realizations parametrized by entropy flow.

\subsection{Comparison functors}
We define entropy comparison functors mediating between realizations.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Realization as functorial flow]
Motivic realization is encoded as entropy-functorial flow.
