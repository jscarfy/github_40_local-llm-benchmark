\section{Flow Endoscopy, Entropy Transfer, and Stable Characters}
\subsection{Entropy transfer principles}
We formulate entropy transfer principles for comparing flow-modified data across related modular/automorphic contexts,
with transfer governed by entropy-weighted orbital and trace constraints.

\subsection{Stable characters under flow}
We define flow-stable characters as deformation-invariant character-like distributions, stabilized by entropy smoothing
and compatible with transfer.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Stability via entropy smoothing]
Stability is achieved by \emph{entropy smoothing} that turns fluctuating character data into deformation-invariant distributions compatible with transfer.
