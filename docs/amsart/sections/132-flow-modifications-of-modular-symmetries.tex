\section{Flow Modifications of Modular Symmetries}
\subsection{Impact of flow symmetries on modular symmetry properties}
We examine the changes in modular symmetry properties under the influence of flow symmetries, focusing on their effects on modular varieties and arithmetic functions.

\subsection{Flow-induced symmetry transformations in modular systems}
We investigate the transformation of modular symmetries induced by flow symmetries, providing new insights into the structure of modular systems and their arithmetic behavior.
