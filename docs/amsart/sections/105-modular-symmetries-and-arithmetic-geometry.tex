\section{Modular Symmetries and Arithmetic Geometry}
\subsection{Modular systems and their geometric transformations}
We investigate how modular systems induce geometric transformations under flow symmetries, providing new interpretations of modular spaces and their arithmetic consequences.

\subsection{Impact of modular symmetries on modular geometry}
We examine the role of modular symmetries in shaping modular geometry, particularly focusing on their impact on arithmetic geometry and modular transformations.
