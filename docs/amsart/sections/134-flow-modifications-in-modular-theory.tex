\section{Flow Modifications in Modular Theory}
\subsection{Impact of flow symmetries on modular theory foundations}
We explore the effect of flow symmetries on the foundational aspects of modular theory, focusing on how flow transformations reshape the interpretation of modular forms and modular systems.

\subsection{New perspectives on modular systems and flow symmetries}
We investigate new perspectives on modular systems, highlighting how flow symmetries provide novel insights into their structure, classification, and interaction with arithmetic geometry.
