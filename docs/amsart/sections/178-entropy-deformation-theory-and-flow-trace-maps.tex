\section{Entropy Deformation Theory and Flow Trace Maps}
\subsection{Entropy deformation theory}
We formulate entropy deformation theory as the study of modular transformations induced by flow modulations.

\subsection{Flow trace maps}
We define flow trace maps that preserve modular symmetries and organize invariants across entropy-induced transformations.

\begin{highlightedSyntaxPhenomenon}[Deformation as flow-induced transformation]
Deformation is viewed as a flow-induced transformation process that organizes modular data via trace maps.
